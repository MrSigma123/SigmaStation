\section*{Introduction}
Understanding algebraic structures is like learning the rules of different "games" in mathematics. Each structure has specific rules that define how numbers or objects interact with each other. Letâ€™s explore these structures step by step, starting from familiar concepts.

\section{Sets and Operations}
A \textbf{set} is simply a collection of objects. For example:
\[ \text{Set of integers: } \mathbb{Z} = \{ \dots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \dots \}. \]

An \textbf{operation} is a rule that takes two elements from a set and combines them to produce another element in the same set. Common operations include addition ($+$), subtraction ($-$), and multiplication ($\cdot$).

\section{Groups}
A \textbf{group} is a set with an operation that satisfies the following four rules:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Closure:} If $a, b$ are in the set, then $a \cdot b$ is also in the set.
    \item \textbf{Associativity:} $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$ for all $a, b, c$ in the set.
    \item \textbf{Identity Element:} There is an element $e$ such that $a \cdot e = a$ for all $a$.
    \item \textbf{Inverse:} For every $a$, there exists $b$ such that $a \cdot b = e$.
\end{enumerate}
Example: The set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ under addition is a group. The identity is $0$, and the inverse of $a$ is $-a$.

\section{Rings}
A \textbf{ring} is a set equipped with two operations, usually called addition ($+$) and multiplication ($\cdot$), that satisfy:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Addition forms a group:} The set with addition is a group.
    \item \textbf{Multiplication is associative:} $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$.
    \item \textbf{Distributive laws:} $a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c)$ and $(a + b) \cdot c = (a \cdot c) + (b \cdot c)$.
\end{itemize}
Example: The set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ is a ring.

\section{Fields}
A \textbf{field} is a ring where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Multiplication also forms a group (excluding $0$).
    \item Every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse.
\end{itemize}
Example: The set of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ is a field.

\section{Polynomials}
Polynomials are expressions like $p(x) = 2x^2 + 3x + 1$. The set of all polynomials with coefficients from a field (e.g., $\mathbb{Q}[x]$) forms a ring. Operations like addition and multiplication follow the same rules as numbers.

\section{$\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ (Integers Modulo $n$)}
The set $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ consists of integers $0, 1, \dots, n-1$, where addition and multiplication "wrap around" after $n$. 

\subsection{Case 1: $n$ is Prime}
If $n$ is a prime number, $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is a \textbf{field}. This means:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Addition and multiplication are well-defined.
    \item Every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse.
\end{itemize}
Example: In $\mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z}$:
\[ 4 + 3 \equiv 2 \pmod{5}, \quad 3 \cdot 4 \equiv 2 \pmod{5}. \]
The inverse of $3$ (mod $5$) is $2$, since $3 \cdot 2 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$.

\subsection{Case 2: $n$ is Composite}
If $n$ is not prime, $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is \textbf{not a field}, because some elements do not have inverses. For instance, in $\mathbb{Z}/6\mathbb{Z}$:
\[ 2 \cdot 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{6}, \]
so $2$ has no inverse.

$\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is still a \textbf{ring} in this case, but not all the properties of a field hold.

\section{Matrices}
A \textbf{matrix} is a rectangular array of numbers. For example:
\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}. \]
Matrices can be added and multiplied under specific rules. 

\subsection{Matrix Properties}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Addition:} Matrices of the same dimensions can be added element by element.
    \item \textbf{Multiplication:} The product of two matrices $A$ and $B$ is defined if the number of columns in $A$ equals the number of rows in $B$.
    \item \textbf{Determinant:} A square matrix has an inverse if and only if its determinant is nonzero.
\end{itemize}
The set of $n \times n$ matrices with entries from a field forms a \textbf{ring}, but not a field since not all matrices have inverses.

\section{Preparing for Vector Spaces}
To study vector spaces, we need to understand fields because vectors are defined over fields. In vector spaces:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Scalars come from a field (e.g., $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$).
    \item Operations like addition and scalar multiplication must follow the rules of the field.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Connecting to Algebraic Structures}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fields provide the framework for scalar multiplication.
    \item Understanding $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ helps with modular arithmetic, which is useful in computer science and cryptography.
    \item Matrix operations link directly to transformations in vector spaces.
\end{itemize}

By mastering these structures, you are ready to dive into the study of vector spaces, which combine algebraic and geometric ideas. Understanding $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$, especially when $n$ is prime, will help you see how fields work in abstract settings, paving the way to more advanced topics.
